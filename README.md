# Snake-AI

To run this project, simply download all the files and store them in the same directory. Then in a code editor or from the command line, run the "agent.py" file.
Once you do this the AI will begin training. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed on your computer (pytorch, matplotplib, ipython, pygame, and numpy)
